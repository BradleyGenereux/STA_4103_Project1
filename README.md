## **INTRODUCTION** ##
> This project explores how various factors in a dataset of Miami housing prices can help predict whether a person can afford a house. The dataset includes features such as property size (LND_SQFOOT, TOT_LVG_AREA), location (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE), proximity to important locations (e.g., RAIL_DIST, OCEAN_DIST, HWY_DIST), the age of the property (age), and its overall condition (structure_quality).

> The primary goal of this analysis is to determine the affordability of a house based on a person's budget and average income, and then predict whether that budget can accommodate houses with various parameters. By analyzing these factors, the project seeks to answer questions such as:

> 1) What parameters most significantly impact house pricing in Miami?
> 2) Can we predict if someone can afford a house based on their income, budget, and the features of available properties?

> The project uses machine learning models to estimate house prices and compare them to a person's budget, allowing for an exploration of which parameters make a house affordable or out of reach.

## **DOCUMENTATION** ##
> The dataset used in this project, Miami Housing Data, is publicly available. You can access the source documentation and more information about the data at the following URL:

> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/miami-housing-dataset

> This dataset contains detailed information about housing prices in Miami, as well as various features including their locations, sizes, and proximity to important landmarks and infrastructure. It was used to analyze the impact of these features on housing prices and to build a model that predicts house affordability.
